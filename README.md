# Relational Databases & Scripting Practice

This repository contains intermediate and advanced PostgreSQL practice projects focused on database design, automation, analytics, and scripting using Bash.

The purpose of this repository is to move beyond isolated SQL exercises and work on reproducible, script-driven database environments similar to real-world backend and data engineering workflows.
